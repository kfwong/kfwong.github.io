Learning raabout Jekyll & Github pages. I've always been wanted to host my own blog for a while. The last one I did was on Wordpress hosted at GoDaddy. Since I've got the chance to try out Jekyll and Github generously offer to host the Jekyll for me so I decided to move my blog here.

Yesterday was my Graduation day at Nanyang Polytechnic, it was the place that nurtured and guided me throughout my 3 years journey. It was emotional that I'll have to leave that place as an alumni and saying goodbye to all my lovely lecturers and friends. I shall never forget their kindness and they will always be in my heart.

I'll be matriculating in August this year to National University of Singapore, taking up Computer Science and I'm extremely excited about it! I'm so going to meet all the famous professors and talents from all over the world OMGOMGOMG YAY!!! If you are one of the prospective student or senior of NUS SoC please say hi!!!

        <h1 class="header author-header" style="margin-bottom: 30px;">About Me</h1>

		<p>Hello there! Kang Fei reporting in! People would call me K.F. (kay-eff), and hey it actually sounds friendlier to me! I'm currently a year one student at NUS pursuing my interest in Computer Science. Say hi to me if you happen to see me at School of Computing! I'm shy and I don't bite <del>that hard</del>, really!</p>

		<h2>My early life, the fate, my choice</h2>
		<p>I was borned, raised and attended <a href="http://www.foonyew.edu.my">high school in Malaysia</a> for 18 years. Soon after I completed my at high school, I was given a choice to serve Singapore NS and then became Singaporean upon completing my service. It was uncommon during that time since people rather not to "waste" their 2 years marching around, especially as a foreigner - I was a Singapore PR then.</p>

		<p>I still remember the day I got my enlistment letter and my mother asking me, "Are you sure you want to take on the offer? You could have stayed and lead a rather peaceful life." I weren't thinking that much then, I just want to see the world, so I didn't care and I went for it.</p>

		<p>It was rather tough. I mean, coming from a foreign country to serve as per local male, I honestly wasn't prepared for all of these. The physical training are holistic, sergeants are strict, and I have difficulties catching up with the locals as English speakers primarily. I was in Tekong Island counting the days I'm going to POP.</p>

		<p>But then, it was quiet an exciting experience as well. I was shy, REALLY shy, nerdy and introverted. NS is where I learned about being open, becoming a leader, and courage in public speaking. I've made a great deal of close friends that remain contact with me till this very day.</p>

		<p>I've always thought that if I were to take root in Singapore, I should go though the same amount of hardship as per any locals. This is what kept me going. I didn't regret it. In fact, I was really grateful I gain so much from it, much more than it's exceeded my expectation. To those who are still nagging about how disastrous NS was to them, it's just a matter of whether one taking it positively or negatively. NS didn't shape me, I shaped myself to become better through its guidance. The outcome is the character I've developed over the 2 years, and that's just being myself.</p>

		<h2>My journey, then</h2>
		<p>I took a rather long detour, and even a longer one. My high school result wasn't good enough to secure a university place for me, so I went for Polytechnic instead. I attended <a href="http://www.nyp.edu.sg/">Nanyang Polytechnic</a> as Information Technology student. It was a great school with helpful lectureres and friends, I would dare say it's definitely the best poly in Singapore! </p>

		<p>It would seem that what I've learned in poly wasn't enough to quench my thirst for more knowledge. I joined <a href="https://www.avpn.asia">Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN)</a> as IT consultant in June 2012, develop and solve their IT issue in business. It was fulfilling as I learned as much as I could and apply them in my studies. My freelance and studies complement each other and I was able to excel in both commitments. AVPN staff are especially kind, and I owe Kevin Teo, the CTO, my thanks for his guidance in my career path.</p>

		<p>I worked at <a href="http://www.ncs.com.sg/">NCS PTE LTD</a> for my final year internship. It was enjoyable and challenging to be able to witness working as a team in IT industry. Due to short of manpower, I was given reason to be more independant. Whenever I faced difficulities that I couldn't solve it alone, the staff are kind enough to lend me a hand and we manage to work it out together.</p>

		<h2>A rather unexpected turn of event</h2>
		<p>I took a month of vacation after I graduated from NYP. My friends called me up to join a startup. I was reluctant at first, yet I was bored at home. I took it up eventually in May 2015. The company is called <a href="https://presentapp.co/">Present</a> - as in the gift. It's owned by Peter Draw, who has a very inspiring personality and a great friend. I was convinced by Iman, the current CTO to join Present as I admire his achievement and wish I could learn more from him. I worked as a backend developer for the application platform API. It was extremely enjoyable and fruitful when I was working there. Unfortunately, I was enrolled in the university in August so I had to leave my position to pursue my dream.</p>

		<h2>A new chapter</h2>
		<p>I was thrilled when I saw the offer letter from <a href="http://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> to study computer science! For I've been rejected 5 years ago, I have proven myself through NS and poly education that I was too, able to reach my goal. It was rather sad as all my friends have already graduated while I'm just about to start my life in university. I have no regrets, because this is the path I've chosen.</p>

		<h2>The unforseen future</h2>
		<p>I do not know what lies ahead. But I do know there are excitements and a clear goal. My duty is to follow my own heart, therefore I live without regrets. My story has not ended yet! The next time you visit this page it'll be much longer!</p>

		<h2>Bored? Skip the rest and read from here</h2>
		<p>Yeah skip the rest above and that's it. I admit I'm quite a boring person. But hey, I do have my interests alright? Just a bit unusual... maybe?</p>

		<p>Let's start with the music I listen to. I love movie & game soundtrack, sometimes ambient music that help me focus. It's not that I hate pop, but I find the lyrics often intefere with my thoughts. My favourite of all times? Final Fantasy sountracks, as long as it's composed by Nobuo Uematsu. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JziuY9jxQH4">Listen to this! I played it myself!</a> His music fits to perfectly that I see myself in the adventure everytime I listen to them. Anybody knows Yoko Shimomura, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0-0zJgjnwI">Joe Hisashi</a>, and perhapes Hans Zimmer? I find myself listening to the "Mood" or "Focus" genre on Spotify quite often. If you are one of a kind, let me know and we could perhapes trade some of our favorites?</p>

		<p>I'm took up interest in boardgames recently. Not just the mainstream Monopoly! I'm sure you've heard of Settlers of Catan or Civilizations? I find boardgames a great way in terms of ice breaking, especially when meeting up with a group of strangers. I'm not a professional collectors but I play as my friends suggest: Avalon, Resistance, Bloodbound, Dominion, Seven Wonders, Puerto Rico, Lifeboat, and so much more I couldn't remember!</p>

		<p>Anybody know <a href="https://www.ingress.com/">Ingress</a>? I'm also an verified agent despite quite inactive. If you are using Android or Iphone, download the app and more importantly, <a href="http://resistance.ingress.sg/">JOIN THE RESISTANCE!</a> Why? Because blue is sexy color! Games aside, the fun begins when all the agents meet up for missions! I've got to know a lot of awesome people through this AR game. Friends of Enlightened do say hi to me too if you recognize me! I don't bite <del>that hard</del>, really! Rivalry in games, friends in reality right?</p>

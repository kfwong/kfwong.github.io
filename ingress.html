<blockquote>Alongside the discovery of the Higgs Boson by the physicists at CERN in 2012, it has also been discovered that the Earth has been seeded with "Exotic Matter," or XM. This substance has been associated with the Shapers, a mysterious phenomenon or alien race which is neither described nor seen (and which thus functions as a MacGuffin). The in-universe motivation for the Enlightened faction is their belief that the Shapers are working toward a powerful enlightenment which will uplift all mankind. The Resistance believes that it is protecting humanity from Shaper ingression.

<h2>In...what?</h2>
<p>Simply put, Ingress is an Augmented Reality (AR) game developed by Niantic Labs of Google. It turns the entire planet into warzone, where agents of two factions battle each other in real-time to gain control of certain area. There will be multiple official event called "XM Anomaly" held across the globe, whereby many agents come together to contribute to their respective faction in order to win the event.</p>

<p>Besides the game itself, there's also story behind the scene, commonly affected by the outcome of the anomaly event. Niantic Lab keep an interesting monthly Ingress Report featuring collaboration work of agents throughout the world.</p>

<p>You can download the application from Android Play Store & Apple AppStore.</p>

<h2>Join the Resistance effort to fight against the Enlightened!</h2>
<p>Being a Resistance agent myself, I've been playing Ingress for more than 2 years. The faction's primary color is blue (Yes, the sexy blue!). I join my fellow teammates to fight against the greenish Enlightened agents, who believe that accepting XM influence will allow human to evolve. Resistance oppose the idea to preserve humanity. There's no right or wrong, but if you believe in the ideal of either factions, you should choose a side!</p>

<h2>Agent Profile</h2>
<p>Remember to ping me if you are playing nearby, no matter which faction you are! I'm always happy to meet up with a fellow agents!</p>
